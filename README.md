# Pop Culture Gifs

## Overview

For this week's assignment we had to use the GIPHY API to develope a dynamic web page that will populate gifs of our choice. To put it simply, the code had to call the GIPHY API while using Javascript and jQuery to change the HTML of the webpage.


## Inspiration

In a broad sense, the main theme here is pop culture. This can span from anime, video games, and western television.

I wanted this theme to be more universal in a sense. Anyone can relate to the topic since we all have a type of media that we enjoy.
